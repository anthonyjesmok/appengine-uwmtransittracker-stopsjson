Important Note: Recently, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee discontinued their API for real-time shuttle tracking pending a complete renovation of the shuttle service. As a result, this project is no longer functional. This code will remain up on GitHub for viewing and critique, but the live site has been taken down.

UWM Transit Tracker Stops.json
===========================
The stops.json file serves as a listing of stops for [appengine-uwmtransittracker](https://github.com/anthonyjesmok/appengine-uwmtransittracker). Each JSON object in stops contains a stop title, the UWM stop tag, the UWM stop number, and an array of MCTS stops to pull in when a user selects that stop.
