UWM Transit Tracker Stops.json
===========================
The stops.json file serves as a listing of stops for [appengine-uwmtransittracker](https://github.com/anthonyjesmok/appengine-uwmtransittracker). Each JSON object in stops contains a stop title, the UWM stop tag, the UWM stop number, and an array of MCTS stops to pull in when a user selects that stop.
